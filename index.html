          <h1>Why you should get a cat??</h1>
          <p>
            A cat has the ability to both calm your nervous system and provide
            an immediate outlet for fun and play. <br />Although cats are
            independent animals who like to scavenge and explore on their own
            terms, they are also very affectionate with their owners and people
            they trust.

          <h1>Why should you get a dog??</h1>
          <p>
            Dogs provide us with a sense of emotional wellbeing thanks to the
            unconditional love they give <br />
            which is why they're also great company and comfort for people who
            live alone.

          <h1>Are exotic pets for you??</h1>
          <p>
            Sometimes known as “exotic pets”, non-traditional companion animals
            (NTCAs) can be very challenging<br />
            to keep as pets due to their complex welfare needs. These needs
            include: a suitable environment and diet;<br />
            being able to display their natural behaviours; and being housed
            with or without other animals as needed.

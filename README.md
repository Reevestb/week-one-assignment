I feel I met all the basic requirements for the assignment, putting all elements on the page within the header, main and footer, then styling in css. I started by creating a wireframe on OkSo which I probably got a bit ahead of myself on being able to turn that into a webpage due to the complexities inside the Main section so in the end I tried to imitate the example website instead. If I was to remake the website again I would give my wireframe idea more of a go as I could use grids to try and achieve it but trying that with my current webpage I created I don‚Äôt think it would have looked as aesthetically pleasing for viewers. So if I was to try again I would change my content to work with grids to fit my current 3 sections into 1 section with 3 boxes/colums and then have the other 2 sections of my webpage as some other information/content.
Using the flex box cheatsheets was really handy in being able to keep checking on what code to write and why. Google was also a help with just answering queries I had such as using the nav bar to being able to go directly to certain parts of the webpage.
I thought adding the background images and using the relative/absolute positioning went really well for me along with positioning elements on the webpage where I wanted them to go and how I wanted them to change using the pseudo class. I did struggle with being able to have my header stay at the top of my page and go over the top of my content, I knew I could fix it at the top of my page but I really wanted it to go over the content and stay there as you scrolled down the page into other sections, group time helped me solve this as I was able to look at others code and see how they did it which gave me a better understanding on how to achieve this again in the future.
One bug I came across was my web page having not having a margin so when I tried to style my header at the time it had an excess of white going around it, after using the console found out that it was because I had not set a Reset css file and after doing this it solved my issue. I had a similar issue with my footer content going past the footer but I fixed this with setting a height to the footer and then re-positioning my elements.
